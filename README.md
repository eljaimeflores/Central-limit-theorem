# Central-limit-theorem
This is a model I made to demostrate what it is the Central limit theorem says.
I provide an explanation to most of my steps, but I am assuming the person reading will have some basic familiarity with statistics.
My background comes mainly from mathematics, so if anyone has any suggestions as to how my code could be more efficient please let me know, I am always trying to improve.
Nevertheless I hope you enjoy it and clears up how we can use this theorem!
