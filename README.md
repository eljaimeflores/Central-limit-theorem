# Central-limit-theorem
This is a model I made to demostrate what it is the Central limit theorem says using python.
I provide an explanation to most of my steps, but I am assuming the person reading will have some basic familiarity with statistics.
I have a strong mathematics background, so I decided to do this as a challange to use of numpy,matplotlib, and pandas outside the classroom setting. I hope you enjoy it and clears up how we can use this theorem!
